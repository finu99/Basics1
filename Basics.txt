1)Arithmetic operators
 Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators such as addition,substraction,multiplication,division,modulus,increment and decrement

+ Used to add values   
Eg c=a+b
_ Used to substact one value from other
Eg c=a-b
* Multiplies the values
Eg c=a*b
/ Performs division
Eg c=a/b
++ Increases the value of a variable by 1
c=++c
-- Decreases the value of a variable by 1
c=--c
% Returns the division remainder
a%b

2)Logical operators
Logical operators are used to find the logic between variables

AND
&& Returns true if both statements are true
Eg a<5 && a<10

OR
|| Returns true if any one of the statement is true
Eg a<5 || a<4

NOT
! Returns true if statement is false
Eg !(a<3&&a<4)

3)Relational operators
Check the relationship between 2 operants
< checks whether the operant is less than the other(a<b)
> checks whether the operant is greater than the other (a>b)
<= less than or equal to the operant(a<=b)
>= greater than or equal  the operant (a>=b)
== Used to compare both operants and returns 1 if both statements are equal,0 if not equal
!= returns 1 if both statements are not equal and 0 if they are equal

4)Bitwise operators
Used to perform operators on the data at bit level 

 Bitwise AND
a=5,b=6
a=0100    b=0110
result 0100

Bitwise OR
result 0110

Bitwise complement operator
a=8
1000
result 0111


5)Conditional operators
 Are decision making statements which depends upon the output of the expression
  
expression1?expression2:expression3;

6)Assignment operator
a=5
 assign 5 to the variable a
 
plus and assign operator
 a+=b or a=a+b

substract and assign operator
 a-=b or a=a-b
multiple and assign operator
 a*=b   a=a*b
divide and assign operator
 a/=b   a=a/b
modulus and assign operator
 a%=b a=a%b

7)Shift operator
 Is used to shift binary bits either in the left direction or in the right direction
 
Left shift operator
 var_name << no_of_position  


Right operator
var_name >> no_of_position
